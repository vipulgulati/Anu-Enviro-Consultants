              Sewage treatment plant helps in removing contaminants from wastewater and household effluent, both runoff (effluents) and domestic. It includes physical, chemical, and
			  biological processes to remove physical, chemical and biological contaminants. Its objective is to produce an environmentally safe fluid waste stream (or treated effluent)
			  and a solid waste (or treated sludge) suitable for disposal or reuse (usually as farm fertilizer).<br>
			  Sewage is generated by residential, institutional, and commercial and industrial establishments. It includes household waste liquid from toilets, baths, showers, kitchens, sinks
			  and so forth that is disposed of via sewers. In many areas, sewage also includes liquid waste from industry and commerce. The separation and draining of household waste into greywater and blackwater is becoming more common in the developed world,
			  with greywater being permitted to be used for watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets. After analyzing and understanding the requirements of institutional, commercial and industrial establishments we provide commercial sewage treatment plant and industrial sewage treatment system which help meet specific client requirement.<br>
			  Sewage is the subset of wastewater that is contaminated with feces or urine, but is often used to mean any wastewater. Sewage includes domestic, municipal, or industrial liquid waste products disposed of, usually via a pipe or sewer (sanitary or combined), sometimes in a cesspool emptier. Wastewater Treatment plants are used to make water reusable by eradicating dissolved impurities present in it.
			  We are one of the top manufacturer of sewage treatment plants (STP) in Agra and we provide STPs in both ways i.e. design only and turnkey plants anywhere in India. Our focus is always been and shall always be to be Reliable and Ennovative (innovative environmental solutions).
			  We are one of the top manufacturers and Supplier of Sewage Treatment Plant, Wastewater Treatment Plant, Effluent Treatment Plant in India.</p>
